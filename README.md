# (WIP) Fuck Storage Access Framework or just FSAF
This library in under heavy development so it's not a good idea to use it yet.

If you ever had to deal with Storage Access Framework you must understand the pain imposed on you by it's API and lack of any good examples.

This tiny library attempts to hide away that API, providing a well-known Java File-like API instead, abstracting away both the SAF files (or DocumentFiles) and the standart Java Files. Basically with this library you don't even need to think about what kind of file to use because it's all being figured out internally.

Samples (TODO)
